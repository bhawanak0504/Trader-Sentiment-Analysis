📄 Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment

* Summary Write-Up – Primetrade.ai Assignment

1️⃣ Methodology

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) impacts trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid.

Data Preparation
Two datasets were used:

- Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (daily sentiment classification)
- Historical trader-level trading data

The datasets were aligned at a daily level after:

- Converted timestamps to daily format
- Aligned both datasets at the daily level
- Removed missing sentiment entries
- Handled leverage outliers and missing values
- Created performance and behavior metrics

Feature Engineering
Key metrics created for analysis included:
- Daily PnL per trader
- Win rate (PnL > 0)
- Average trade size
- Leverage usage
- Trade frequency
- Long/Short ratio
- Drawdown proxy (PnL volatility proxy)

Analytical Framework
The analysis consisted of:
1. Compared performance metrics between Fear and Greed regimes
2. Conducted independent two-sample t-tests to evaluate statistical significance
3. Evaluating behavioral shifts in trade size, leverage, and activity levels
4. Segmented traders by:
    - High vs Low leverage
    - Frequent vs Infrequent traders
    - Consistent vs Inconsistent performers
5. Built a logistic regression model to predict trade profitability using sentiment and behavioral features

An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to enable dynamic exploration of these results.

2️⃣ Key Insights

Insight 1: Sentiment Impacts Profitability

Greed days show higher average profitability compared to Fear days.
The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05), indicating that trader performance varies meaningfully across sentiment conditions.

Insight 2: Leverage Amplifies Risk During Fear Regimes

High-leverage traders experience disproportionately larger drawdowns during Fear periods.
While leverage enhances upside in favorable regimes, it disproportionately amplifies losses in negative sentiment environments.

Insight 3: Consistency Reduces Sentiment Sensitivity

Frequent and consistent traders maintain relatively stable win rates across sentiment regimes.
In contrast, inconsistent traders show higher volatility and are more sensitive to emotional market shifts.

3️⃣ Strategy Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following data-driven strategy guidelines are proposed:

1. Sentiment-Aware Leverage Controls

- Reduce leverage exposure during Fear regimes, particularly for traders with historically high PnL volatility.
- This mitigates amplified drawdowns during adverse sentiment cycles.

2. Selective Position Scaling in Greed

- Increase position sizing moderately during Greed regimes, but only for traders with historically consistent performance.
- This captures favorable momentum while maintaining risk discipline.

3. Dynamic Risk Segmentation

Apply differentiated controls by trader profile:

- High-leverage traders → stricter risk caps during Fear
- Inconsistent traders → tighter stop-loss thresholds
- Consistent traders → controlled flexibility in scaling

4. Predictive Risk Signaling

- A machine learning classifier was developed to estimate trade profitability using sentiment, leverage, and trade size.
- Such models can serve as early risk indicators and assist in dynamic capital allocation decisions.

4️⃣ Conclusion

This study demonstrates that market sentiment significantly impacts both trader behavior and profitability.

Incorporating sentiment-aware leverage controls and trader segmentation into risk management frameworks can enhance performance stability while reducing downside exposure.

The combination of statistical validation, behavioral segmentation, and predictive modeling provides a scalable, data-driven foundation for sentiment-informed trading optimization.
